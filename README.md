# Restaurant app in C++

My first major project, which I carried out together with a few friends at the beginning of my studies (December 2021).

The program allows you to place an order in a restaurant and has the following functions:
- displaying the menu downloaded from the text file
- allows you to order on site or take away
- adding/deleting items to an order
- creating a bill to a text file

**The executable file is the final version of the app and is no longer being developed.**

Several features should be modified, but each of us had to deal with other projects. 

The documentation of this app was created only in Polish.
